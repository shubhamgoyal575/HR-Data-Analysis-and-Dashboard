# HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI + EDA in Python

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of HR data through two components:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.
- **Interactive HR Analytics Dashboard** built in Power BI.

The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and key HR metrics that help organizations make data-driven decisions about workforce management.
